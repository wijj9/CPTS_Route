# Web Attacks

## **Introduction**

> Web applications are very common and utilized for most businesses.\
> As modern web applications become more complex and advanced, so do the types of attacks utilized against them. This leads to a vast attack surface, which is why web attacks are the most common types of attacks against companies.\
> \
> Attacking external-facing web applications may result in compromise of the businesses' internal network, which may eventually lead to stolen assets or disrupted services.\
> Even if a company has no external facing web applications, they likely utilize internal web applications, or external facing API endpoints, both of which are vulnerable to the same types of attacks and can be leveraged to achieve the same goals.
